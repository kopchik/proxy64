6proxy4
=======

Proxy traffic from IPv6 to IPv4 back and forth.
Unlike tinyproxy and other proxies:
1. Just mirrors traffic between sockets.
1. Has only neccessary settings
1. Only python is required to work
1. It was created by me :)
1. Supports gevent (TODO)

Note that all addresses are resolved only once on start.
